<h2>Slide and Stack Glass Walls</h2>
Looking for custom exterior doors for either your business or home? Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup> finally has the perfect solution in our Slide &amp; Stack Glass Walls. Comprise these operable walls of individual panels which slide along a top hung track and stack to a remote location. The Slide &amp; Stack System is designed to accommodate many panels, and typically ranges in sizes over 48" wide. While the wall is open, the panels stack into a parking bay. Panel parking bays can be parallel or perpendicular to the track, feature multiple bays, exist at one or both ends of the wall, or stack into a pocketed area. In addition, custom bays can be designed to make the most out of any project's spacial constraints. Slide &amp; Stack Glass Walls are top hung systems requiring headers to bear the weight of the unit. Any engineering questions can be discussed furthermore with Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup>' in-house engineering team.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="2/3"][vc_column_text]<img class="alignleft wp-image-36864 size-full" title="slide &amp; stack glass walls" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/Stack-Desc.png" alt="slide &amp; stack glass walls" width="896" height="584" />[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row css=".vc_custom_1502913840172{padding-top: 50px !important;}"][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Trackless Options</h2>
Install our Slide &amp; Stack Systems without a floor track for a completely seamless transition between two spaces. After closing, our two point locking handles secure the concealed rods into discrete individual dust proof floor strikes. Our trackless option is especially useful for conference room dividers and other flexible multipurpose environments where an wider floor space is desired when open.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row css=".vc_custom_1502972276540{padding-top: 50px !important;}"][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]<img class="alignnone wp-image-36895 size-full" title="slide &amp; stack glass walls" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/Stack-Finish-1.png" alt="slide &amp; stack glass walls" width="896" height="488" />
<h2>Frames &amp; Finishes</h2>
Use Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup>' Slide &amp; Stack Glass WallsÂ as either interior or exterior walls with thermal or non-thermal rail options. Thermally-enhanced frames contain insulbar, which creates a barrier preventing temperature transfer year round. Use non-thermal frames for interior systems, in applications with limited weather exposure, or rather those regions with minimal weather fluctuation. A wide range of standard, designer, and custom finishes are available, including wood clad &amp; veneer options.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]<img class="alignnone wp-image-36893 size-full" title="slide &amp; stack glass walls" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/Stack-Config-1.png" alt="slide &amp; stack glass walls" width="896" height="488" />
<h2>Configurations</h2>
Utilize Slide &amp; Stack Glass Walls for straight, angular, multiple face, and curved openings. Design units in a 60 degree, twin trolley configuration. Locate the dual trolleys above the vertical rails of the glass panels allowing them to slide with greater ease along the track, and the 60 degree design of the panel parking bay allows for one hand operation of the stacking panels. Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup> also designs and engineers custom trolley and stacking configurations. Finally, install these systems with Solar or with one of our nationwide dealers.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]<img class="alignnone wp-image-36896 size-full" title="slide &amp; stack glass walls" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/Stack-Glazing.png" alt="slide &amp; stack glass walls" width="896" height="488" />
<h2>Glazing Options</h2>
Solar InnovationsÂ® Slide &amp; Stack Glass Walls can incorporate any glazing option available on the market today. Utilize Low-e glazing for both residential and commercial applications because it helps maintain a comfortable indoor temperature, reduces energy consumption, and provides protection from UV rays. Custom decorative glass options are also available to create a unique look or match an existing project. The glass can be tinted, acid etched, frosted, art glass, or contain applied grids (available with multiple pattern options).[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]<img class="alignleft wp-image-36917 size-full" title="slide &amp; stack glass walls" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/Stack-Operation-300.gif" alt="slide &amp; stack glass walls" width="300" height="271" />
<h2>Operation</h2>
The Slide &amp; Stack System operates as individual top hung panels which slide along a track and stack to a remote location. After closing panels, they are secured in place with the turn of a handle, bolting the panels into both the track above and the sill below. In our standard 60 degree panel stacking bay configurations, the panels can typically operate while using a single hand.

This provides the option to enter and exit without being required to open all the panels on the entire system. Stacking glass walls can also incorporate various <a href="https://solarinnovations.com/parts-service/sills/">sill options</a> to enhance usability, limit dust collection, and increase water performance.

Â Operable panels can also include door closers, an <a href="https://solarinnovations.com/parts-service/hardware/adjustable-door-catch/">adjustable door catch</a>, and/or multiple options for locking mechanisms. Dust proof strikes can also be incorporated to eliminate the build-up of dust or debris in the sill.
