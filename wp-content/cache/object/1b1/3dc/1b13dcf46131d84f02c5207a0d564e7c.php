Hobby greenhouses are typically less than 10‚Äô x 10‚Äô, making them ideal for the casual gardener. Hobby greenhouses can be utilized for starting seedlings, propagating plants, and other general gardening.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]
<h2>Educational Greenhouses</h2>

Many universities and even high schools use greenhouses to study plant growth, pesticides, and genetics. Vocational schools can use greenhouses for propagation and landscaping work, and even elementary schools are beginning to use educational greenhouses.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]
<h2>Research Greenhouses</h2>
<a href="/our-products/aluminum-structures/greenhouses/research-greenhouses/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-36669 size-full" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/research-greenhouse.png" alt="Research greenhouse" width="440" height="200" /></a>Research greenhouses often include several individual rooms for potting plants, storing and applying pesticides, cold storage, composting, a ‚Äúsick room‚Äù for unhealthy plants, and autoclave rooms for conducting experiments. Solar‚Äôs research greenhouses can be designed with as many rooms as required, as well as outdoor growing areas linked directly to the greenhouse.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]
<h2>Institutional Greenhouses</h2>
<a href="/our-products/aluminum-structures/greenhouses/institutional-greenhouses/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-36665 size-full" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/institutional-greenhouse.png" alt="Institutional Greenhouse" width="440" height="200" /></a>Institutional greenhouses are mostly used for pleasure gardening within an organization. Many prisons use greenhouses for training inmates and teaching them new life skills that will help them with future employment.¬† Nursing homes, hospitals, and rehab facilities also use institutional greenhouses for their therapeutic benefits.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]
<h2>Specialty Greenhouses</h2>
<a href="/our-products/aluminum-structures/greenhouses/specialty-greenhouses/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-36664 size-full" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/specialty-greenhouse.png" alt="Specialty Greenhouse" width="440" height="200" /></a>Specialty greenhouses are designed for a specific plant species and often contain different climate zones to accommodate the needs of the species‚Äô hot weather and cold weather plants. Solar‚Äôs multi-zoned specialty greenhouses can be designed to suit the needs of bonsai trees, orchids, tropical plants, palms, and practically any plant variety.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]
<h2>Pit Greenhouse</h2>
<a href="/our-products/aluminum-structures/greenhouses/pit-greenhouses/"><img class="alignnone wp-image-36666 size-full" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/pit-greenhouse.png" alt="Pit Greenhouse" width="440" height="200" /></a>Implementing a ‚Äúpit‚Äù greenhouse is an energy efficient alternative to a traditional greenhouse. Pit greenhouses are typically located four feet below ground, where the Earth retains an approximate temperature of 50 degrees; therefore, if 70 degrees is required, the temperature will only need to be raised 20 degrees. Pit greenhouses are often attached to a preexisting structure in a lean-to or double pitch configuration, which will transfer heat and act as additional insulation.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]
<h2>Urban Greenhouse</h2>
<a href="/our-products/aluminum-structures/greenhouses/urban-greenhouse/"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-36674 size-full" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/urban-greenhouse.png" alt="City Greenhouses" width="440" height="200" /></a>A greenhouse is normally smaller in scale when located in an urban area, as compared to a rural setting. The reduced size means the space allocation inside the greenhouse becomes more creative and specifically planned. The framework of an urban greenhouse will be constructed out of durable aluminum that will not rot, rust, warp, or require constant finish maintenance.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_tta_tabs style="flat" shape="square" active_section="1"][vc_tta_section i_icon_fontawesome="fa fa-info-circle" add_icon="true" title="Product Overview" tab_id="1503414294912-bbc9bfab-822d"][vc_column_text]<a href="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/SI5000-Glazed-Structures-Cut-Sheet.pdf"><img class="alignright wp-image-25556 size-full" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/coverpage1.png" alt="" width="400" height="248" /></a>Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup> has been creating high quality durable Glazed Structures since 1998 for both commercial and residential applications, creating a line of functional accessories and decorative elements.
