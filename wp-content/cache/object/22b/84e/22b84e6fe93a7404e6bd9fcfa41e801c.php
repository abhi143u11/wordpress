When closed, these doors and windows provide outstanding thermal and acoustical performance, creating a comfortable indoor environment year round and significantly reducing heating and cooling costs. Vinyl-composite framing requires minimal maintenance; it is moisture resistant and will not rust, warp, or rot over time. Large chambers can accommodate reinforcement inserts for spacious openings in commercial applications, and multiple locking points are available.

<h3>SWING DOORS</h3>
<a href="https://solarinnovations.com/our-products/vinyl-doors/vinyl-composite-terrace-doors-and-french-doors/">Vinyl-Composite Terrace and French Doors</a> are ideal for both commercial and residential applications with energy efficiency requirements. Both configurations have a durable uPVC framing that can withstand extreme weather conditions. Transoms and side lights can be added to the uPVC doors with ease.Â  The vinyl frame will not rot, warp, or rust like many other systems. Vinyl does not conduct heat or cold through the framing and into the interior room, which helps create an energy efficient home or business.

<h3>TILT TURN WINDOWS</h3>
Though we offer a variety of fixed and operable <a href="https://solarinnovations.com/our-products/vinyl-windows/vinyl-composite-window-systems/">Vinyl-Composite Windows</a>, our Vinyl-Composite Tilt Turn Windows are one of the most popular. A Tilt Turn Window offers two separate operation functions; turn the handle to the side and open the window as a hopper, or turn the handle upward to open as a casement. The hopper position provides additional safety by minimizing the accessible open space; however, the casement option allows for larger airflow into a room. This window offers flexibility, air circulation options, and safety with all the energy efficient and low maintenance properties of vinyl-composite.
