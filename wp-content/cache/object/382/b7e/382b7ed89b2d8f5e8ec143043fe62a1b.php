<h1>SDLs, Grids and Interior Muntins</h1>
SDLs, ¬†grids and interior muntins enhance the look of any glass structure. Grids are available in three standard types: Ogee, Traditional, and Colonial.

Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup> offers two types of grids: interior muntins and exterior grids with interior simulated divided lites (SDLs).Place the interior muntins in the airspace between two panes of glass. We for these grids into almost any style, including radius designs, such as a Palladian or a radius arch. Muntins are available in Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup>'s five standard paint colors, unfinished aluminum, and anodized finishes: clear and dark bronze. Interior muntins are typically more cost effective and are easier to clean. As a result, they are excellent choices for rooms that easily become dirty, such as a greenhouse.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="2/3"][vc_single_image image="38466" img_size="full"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38468" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/decorative-sdls.png" alt="" width="680" height="400" /></h2>
<h2>SDLs</h2>
Simulate divided lites (SDLs) use exterior trim and an interior aluminum bar to ‚Äúsimulate‚Äù a true division.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38469" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/decorative-grids.png" alt="" width="680" height="400" /></h2>
<h2>Grids</h2>
Exterior grids use exterior trim only to give the appearance of divided lites, but the space between the glass is visible when viewed closely.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38470" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/decorative-interior-muntins.png" alt="" width="680" height="400" /></h2>
<h2>Muntins</h2>
Interior muntins also provide the look of a divided lite from a distance, and they are the easiest to clean, but the space between the glass and the muntin is visible when viewed closely. Please note: interior muntins are only available in Bronze, Hartford Green, Sandstone, Black, White, and Natural Clay.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38471" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/decorative-grids-sdls-muntins.png" alt="" width="680" height="400" /></h2>
<h2>Customization</h2>
Exterior grids¬†are grid placed on the outside of the window which will be in contact with the elements. This grid style is available in our standard paint finishes, clear or dark bronze anodized, and any custom color. This type of grid can be applied to monolithic or insulated glass. For insulated glass, the air space is occupied by an SDL, following the shape of the grids for seamless integration. This piece is available in black or silver and mimics the look of antique grids. There are four different profiles available. Each of the four styles are available in numerous patterns, including any custom design you would like.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38472" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/decorative-muntins-sdls-grids.png" alt="" width="680" height="400" /></h2>
<h2>Glazing Options</h2>
Apply grids to flat glazing and not to curved eave units or sloped glazing for most applications. Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup> also offers a variety of etched glazing options. In addition, these specialty glass choices can be incorporated into the transom area of any structure, as well as any other panel. Utilize leaded glass and applied lead options in certain applications for greater design flexibility.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_single_image image="38473" img_size="full"][/vc_column][vc_column width="3/4"][vc_column_text]
<h2>Available for Doors &amp; Windows</h2>
Finally, use both grid types in any of the wall glass, including standard bays, fixed and operable windows, doors, folding glass walls and windows, sliding glass doors and windows, and transom bays. Also, you cannot apply SDLs, grids, and interior muntins to curved eave units and sloped glazing.

<strong>Please Note: </strong><em>Use internal dividers in an insulating glass unit, such as grilles, muntin bars, or simulated divided lites, there is the potential that dividers will contact the airspace glass surfaces (surface #2 and #3) of the insulating glass unit.</em>

<strong>This can occur under the following conditions:</strong>¬†<em>When the insulating glass unit airspace pressure is below the atmospheric pressure (IG unit is concave).</em>[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:31:"SDLs Grids and Interior Muntins";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:31:"sdls-grids-and-interior-muntins";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-08-31 19:42:30";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-08-31 19:42:30";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:25970;s:4:"guid";s:42:"http://solarinnovations.com/?page_id=26068";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
