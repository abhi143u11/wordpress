<h1>Transom Grids</h1>
Transom grids are a type of window above a door, window, or other glazing materials; the most common type are found above a door.¬† Sizes of transoms also mimic the size of the door. On a 36‚Äù wide door, you will usually find a 36‚Äù transom that is 24‚Äù in height.¬† A rule of thumb for a standard proportional transom height is to use 1/3 of the door‚Äôs height. A large curtain wall can utilize a transom and will follow the bay divisions of the wall. At times, the transom can be cut to an arch shape for functional or aesthetic purposes.

A transom is typically also fixed glass or operates like a hopper window. A fixed transom has no operable parts. Its main purpose is to let light into a room and provide architectural appeal.¬† An operable transom has a hinge at the bottom of the window. The transom will then open into a room, preventing rain, wind, or snow from entering room during inclement weather.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Decorative Additions</h2>
Traditional transoms are often with gridwork, especially in traditional applications. Decorative items are added when the building is in a historic district or needs curb appeal. One of the most popular additions to a transom is a Palladian arch. In this case, we use a half round transom and determine the exact radius by the client.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Lead Grids</h2>
Finally, another decorative grid option is to include lead grids on the transoms. This is also a very historical style. Old homes and buildings also were using lead grids before any of the vinyl or aluminum grids were invented. Utilize stain glass windows leaded gridding, and in conclusion, this is where leaded grids became popular.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:13:"Transom Grids";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:13:"transom-grids";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-08-31 20:10:30";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-08-31 20:10:30";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:25970;s:4:"guid";s:42:"http://solarinnovations.com/?page_id=26072";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
