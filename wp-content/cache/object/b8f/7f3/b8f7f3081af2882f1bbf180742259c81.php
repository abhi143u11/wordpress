<h1>Solar Innovations History</h1>
An industry leader for more than 17 years, Solar Innovations Â®, can trace its history back to the early 1950â€™s and the inception of Everlite Greenhouses. Everlite was purchased in the 1980â€™s for its dealer network by an existing sunroom manufacturer in Maryland.

The manufacturer took over the Everlite name and began distributing replacement parts for the original company. However, this limited its manufacturing to a new sunroom product and the development of a Mahogany interior/aluminum exterior conservatory. As a result, Everlite produced sunrooms through the 1980â€™s and eventually sold its equipment and designs to several entities.

One of these entities moved its operations to York, PA and proceeded to manufacture wood and aluminum products. Greg Header was hired by the company as a consultant in 1997. The company underwent a re-organization and on April 15, 1998, Solar Innovations Â® was formed. Greg Header became President and Darren Coder was named Vice President.

Solar now resides in a state-of-the art 300,000 sq. ft. corporate office and manufacturing facility. It is now part of a three building campus on 24 acres in Pine Grove, PA, and employs over 170 team members. Since Solarâ€™s inception it has consistently grows by at least 25% per year.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]
