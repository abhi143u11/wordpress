<h1>Vertically Integrated</h1>
While many manufacturers in architectural market space continue to outsource their components and processes to other vendors and overseas, Solar instead works towards producing as many components as possible within our manufacturing facility to provide greater control over lead times and pricing to our valued customers.

By producing as much as possible in-house, instead of purchasing parts from outside vendors at a marked up price, Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup> is able to better control our prices to our customers. Superior technical support can also be offered on our products, since it is provided directly from the individual who created or assembled them. Most of all if you have a question, we can provide the answer, which is hard to find in today's market.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:14:"Why Choose Us?";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:13:"why-choose-us";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-08-22 14:20:49";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-08-22 14:20:49";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:60;s:4:"guid";s:42:"http://solarinnovations.com/?page_id=18376";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
