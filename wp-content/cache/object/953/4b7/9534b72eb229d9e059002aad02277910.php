<h2>Glass Railings</h2>
Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup>‚Äôs glass railings are designed for residential and commercial applications. The dry glazed mounting shoe provides a cleaner, simpler installation (as compared to wet set railing systems) that delivers excellent performance, long term serviceability, and adjust-ability.

Glass railings are a very popular piece of architecture in today‚Äôs culture. Walking through malls, airports, and hotels you see glass railings. The railing helps create a modern architectural design to the space. There are many different styles and manufacturers of glass railing systems.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="2/3"][vc_single_image image="38031" img_size="full"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_single_image image="38034" img_size="full"][/vc_column][vc_column width="3/4"][vc_column_text]
<h2>ASTM E985-00¬†Approved</h2>

<h2>Railing System Design</h2>
The basis of the design is a stainless steel shoe which holds a solid piece of glass in place, typically ¬Ω‚Äù tempered. Each piece of glass within the railing system is completely independent of the next. None of the glass pieces will touch, allowing a small space between each section. The top of the glass can be either exposed or fit with a round stainless steel cap. Railing systems can also be incorporated into the solid glass. Each section of glass will be formed with three openings for the Stainless Steel posts which support the railing.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Customization</h2>

The length is unlimited; we will work with whatever size you require. The glass used on the railing system can have a tint or a design etched into the piece to achieve a more unique look.
