Team members and their families enjoyed a day learning the inhabitants of Swope Valley Run, the stream that runs through the 36-plus acre corporate campus and even got to release a few young critters into the wild.

The event started in the stream, where a former member of the PA Fish and Boat Commission showed visitors how many unsuspecting creatures can be found in a stream just by shuffling around a few rocks. Next, guests were given the chance to try their hand at casting a fly reel, followed by releasing butterflies in Solarâ€™s garden with our greenhouse specialists. At noon, everyone enjoyed a picnic lunch, followed by fly tying with Schuylkill Countyâ€™s Trout Unlimited. There was also a quail release at the edge of the wooded area on campus. Solar Innovations, Inc. enjoyed hosting the event and was happy to see guests of all ages excited to learn and build the ecosystem.
