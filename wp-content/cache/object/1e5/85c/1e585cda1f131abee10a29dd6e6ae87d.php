<h2>Complete Glazing Packages</h2>
Home owners often buy windows, doors, and skylights from three different suppliers, as a result, may coordinate issues, and the quality will vary between systems. Consequently, sight lines will also vary between units, frame colors will be slightly off, and the glazing warranties will be different.Â To avoid this situation, Solar InnovationsÂ® suggests aÂ complete glazing package, or window and door schedule, from a single supplier.

These products feature similar finishes, sightlines, and warranties. Constructing the productsâ€™ framework from durable aluminum, therefore it will not rot, warp, rust, or require constant finish maintenance. Complete glazing packages feature same finish and sightlines and supplying warranties through a single glass company.Â Glazing your products in your complete glazing package will aid in collecting heat by allowing sunlight to enter. In addition to sunlight, complete glazing packages provide customers with spectacular views.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="2/3"][vc_single_image image="36996" img_size="full"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Finishes</h2>
Solar offers five standard paint finishes, two anodized finishes, and custom colors (for an additional charge). When sourcing through many manufacturers, it is impossible to guarantee frame finishes will perfectly match one another. White frames were particularly difficult to match, as each manufacturer creates a unique shade of white.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]
