<h1>Decorative Wall Panels</h1>
Wall panels or base panels, by Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup>¬†follow the Elizabethan form of raised base panels. We construct each panel out of aluminum, therefore, the panels will not rot, rust, warp, or require constant finish maintenance. Solar currently offers two standard models: a raised panel and a smooth panel. On the raised panel, the elevated face is ¬º‚Äù tall and protrudes ¬Ω‚Äù¬†from the panel base. In addition, the offset distance of the elevated square can also be custom to the customer‚Äôs specifications. ¬†Smooth panels are often used on a building‚Äôs interior where it will be hidden by desks or benches. Custom grids can be utilized upon request.

The wall panels can be used either in new construction or retrofitted into existing structures. Common applications include glass structures, such as greenhouses, sunrooms, conservatories, and pool enclosures in place of a traditional masonry or rather a cement knee wall.¬† Outdoor porches which encounter the elements utilize a knee wall but can be replaced with raised base panels for a more decorative look. Also, base panels can add a classic yet, traditional look to swing doors, folding doors, and sliding doors.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_single_image image="38438" img_size="full"][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:22:"Decorative Wall Panels";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:22:"decorative-wall-panels";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-08-31 15:09:12";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-08-31 15:09:12";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:25970;s:4:"guid";s:42:"http://solarinnovations.com/?page_id=26052";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
