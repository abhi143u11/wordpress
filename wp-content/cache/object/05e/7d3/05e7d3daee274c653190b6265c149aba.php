Folding windows by Solar Innovations¬Æ are almost identical to folding doors. These windows can be utilized for both commercial and residential applications.¬† The appeal of folding windows is the ability to completely open a view. There are no bars or mullions obstructing the windows when they are open, which allows for a beautiful view.¬†Various sill options can be utilized for each application and to meet design and performance requirements.

<h2>Residential</h2>
The windows are often used for enclosed patios, sunrooms, and serving windows between kitchens and dining rooms in residential settings. All residential folding glass walls are constructed out of sturdy aluminum. This allows for a durable frame that will not warp, rot, or need constant finish¬†maintenance. There are several screening options available to keep out unwanted pests, while still allowing guests to enjoy the natural environment.

<h2>Commercial</h2>
Commercial applications include restaurant windows, hotel windows, and stadium boxes. Open up a restaurant to patio seating or pass food through the folding glass windows from the kitchen. An all aluminum frame makes the folding glass windows suitable for hospital or retirement home facilities.¬† One of several ADA compliant sill options can be utilized to meet code requirements in such instances.

<h2>Customization</h2>
All folding windows are completely custom to your particular job. As a result, the number of panels, the direction of the panels, and dimensions of the unit and panels are all cut to your measurements. Therefore you can add wood veneer to the frame to mimic the look of a true wooden window as well as other decorative options. Eight standard finishes are available along with any custom color your job may require. Also, corrosion resistant anodized options are available. There are two frame types available: thermal and non-thermal. Utilize non-thermal frames in interior applications and where the windows do not come in contact with rain or the wind.

<h2>Grid Profiles</h2>
Customers choose from several different grid profiles including a square, Ogee, and traditional shape. The gridwork can match the frame finish or be a different color which adds visual appeal. Stained glass, art glass, etched glass, and any other decorative glass can be utilized in the folding windows.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]
