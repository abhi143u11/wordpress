<h2>Hopper Windows</h2>
Hopper windows are hinged at the bottom and tilt in to offer increased ventilation. Hopper windows are often paired with other fixed or operable windows and doors or incorporated into transoms.¬†Basement windows are another popular use for hopper windows. Windows in basements are essential for light and ventilation, and the hopper window fulfills both needs in the limited space typically provided by basements.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row css=".vc_custom_1503417365216{padding-top: 50px !important;}"][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text css=".vc_custom_1503417421940{padding-top: 20px !important;}"]<img class="alignnone wp-image-37212 size-full" title="Hopper Windows" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/Hopper-History-2-e1503417327985.png" alt="" width="870" height="747" />[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="2/3"][vc_column_text]
<h2>¬†History</h2>
Hopper windows became popular during the 19th century. At the time, this window served several purposes. Automobiles and paved roads were still only a novelty, and horses on dirt roads were the means of transportation for the country. The unpaved roads created large amounts of dust. When home owners opened their windows, a flurry of dust overtook the home.

The invention of the hopper window allowed for light and ventilation to permeate the home while restricting the amount of dust that could enter. Hopper windows were used on transoms, where the window was hinged at the bottom and tilted into the room. The dust from the roads was minimal at transom height--typically 7‚Äô0‚Äù above finished floor--compared to traditional window height. Another common use for the hopper window was to cool food. Homes built during this period had deep window sills where pies and hot items were set to cool. Opening the hopper window allowed fresh air to enter the home and assist in cooling the food.

While traditional historical hopper windows were built with wood, Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup> uses a durable aluminum frame that will not warp, rot, or require constant finish maintenance over time.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_column_text]
