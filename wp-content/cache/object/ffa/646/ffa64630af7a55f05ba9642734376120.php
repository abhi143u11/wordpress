<h1>Garden Windows</h1>
Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup> is a manufacturer of glazed garden windows, or greenhouse windows. These windows can be used to replace a standard flat window in a gardenerâ€™s in-home haven. Garden windows project outward from the existing structure to create a shelf or set of shelves commonly used to house plants,Â including flowers and herbs. Custom garden windows are designed to allow plants which thrive on sunlight to achieve to their maximum potential. Often, an existing bay window can be converted into a garden window with the addition of shelving. Supportive base walls can be provided by Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup>, or the units can be designed to install on an existing base wall.

Traditional garden windows are in the shape of a lean-to, which attaches to the home. Custom shapes, such as hip ends or double pitches, are also available. Since all sizes are completely custom, there are no standard designs or sizes you must maintain. If you have an existing garden window which needs replaced and is a unique size, Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup> can produce a new unit to fit your exact specifications.

<h2>Mini Greenhouses</h2>
Almost any plant can be grown in a garden window, since they serve as miniature greenhouses. Many gardeners will grow herbs, orchids, and houseplants in their windows. Late winter is an excellent time to start seeds in the garden window. Full sized greenhouses can become expensive, but garden windows are a much more economical solution. One of the least expensive units on the market today is a vinyl garden window.

<h2>Benefits &amp; Options</h2>
While the cost savings with vinyl may be a benefit, the long term durability of the window will disappoint the owner. Vinyl garden windows tend to warp and leak over time. These factors are why Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup> offers an all aluminum garden window. The metal framework will not leak, warp, or rot like wood or vinyl. There are eight standard colors available along with any custom color your job may require. Copper cladding is a decorative option that is often added to the exterior of the window for aesthetic appeal. Gridwork can be added to match the homeâ€™s windows or to create a unique focal point. Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup>â€™s window systems are available with several decorative options, including grids, simulated divided lites (SDLs); beveled, etched or leaded glass; and applied radius or gothic corners.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Ventilation</h2>
Many times, garden windows are vented with the use of ridge vents or operable windows. If the garden window is under 100 square feet, the unit should not require additional ventilation, as the existing structureâ€™s heating and cooling system should take care of the garden windowâ€™s needs. As long as insulated glass is used with a LowE tint, the garden window will be fine without additional ventilation. However, if the garden window becomes a larger size, additional ventilation, such as awning/casement windows and ridge vents, can be used.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_column_text]
