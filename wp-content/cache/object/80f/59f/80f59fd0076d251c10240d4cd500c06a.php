<h2>Walkways</h2>
Glass walkways are typically pathways enclosed on all four sides which connect two buildings or provide a sheltered walking area directly from the street. Glass Walkways can range from a simple lean-to attachment to a free standing decorative thoroughfare. Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup>‚Äô walkways can be used for both commercial and residential applications. Common uses for commercial aluminum walkways are healthcare facilities, schools, hotels, and businesses. Residential applications include passages between a home and pool enclosure or the home to a detached garage. All of these applications provide shade and protection from the weather as people pass from one location to another, while enjoying the view around them. Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup> offers many cost effective options for both residential and commercial walkways which can be customized to meet each project‚Äôs requirements.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="2/3"][vc_single_image image="37311" img_size="full"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-37327" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/walkway-polycarbonate-1.png" alt="" width="680" height="400" /></h2>
<h2>Polycarbonate</h2>
Several walkway glazing options exist: glass and polycarbonate. Polycarbonate tends to be less expensive as compared to glass and shipping costs are reduced due to weight. There are several different color options available including green, blue, clear, bronze and opal. Polycarbonate comes in different thicknesses ranging from 8mm to 60mm. Modern styles are easy to achieve with polycarbonate.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Glass</h2>
Glass is the traditional choice for walkways. There are more design options available with glass; it is virtually unlimited in its colors, types and thicknesses. Polycarbonate tends to blur the view to the walkway‚Äôs exterior whereas with glass, a person can clearly see the views going on around them. Typically single wall polycarbonate or monolithic glass are used for unheated spaces, while insulated glass or polycarbonate is incorporated into heated environments.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_single_image image="37312" img_size="full"][/vc_column][vc_column width="2/3"][vc_column_text]
