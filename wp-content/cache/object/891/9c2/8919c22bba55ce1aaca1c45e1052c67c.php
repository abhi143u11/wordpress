<h2>Aluminum Curtain Walls</h2>
Curtain walls are an excellent way to bring natural light into a room while remaining protected from the elements. All curtain walls manufactured by Solar are constructed out of durable aluminum. The benefit of an aluminum curtain wall is the reduction in required maintenance.¬†Aluminum curtain walls will not rot, rust, warp, expand with heat, or require constant finishing. ¬†Curtain walls are listed on the <a href="http://csinet.org/">Construction Specifications Institute website</a> under the <a href="http://csinet.org/numbersandtitles">MasterFormat</a>.¬†All Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup> curtain wall frames are custom built to meet the exact dimensions of your opening.

Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup> offers eight standard frame finish colors and unfinished aluminum; custom finish options are available at an additional cost.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="2/3"][vc_single_image image="37096" img_size="full"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Commercial</h2>
Commercial applications are most often designed, engineered, and installed by Solar as storefronts. The curtain wall can be utilized on virtually any type of business. A system can be added to the exterior of your building or utilized for interior divisions between departments or as office walls. A glass hallway is a unique option that can be constructed to achieve an open office appearance.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Residential</h2>
In residential applications, curtain walls can be constructed for exterior walls that showcase a beautiful view, interior partitions between rooms, as well as secondary structures, such as pool houses or garden sheds. In many residences, a large curtain wall is used in a living room, dining room, or kitchen. The public areas of a home are ideal for a curtain wall, but when privacy is not an issue, they blend well in bathrooms and bedrooms.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Glazing Options</h2>
Numerous glazing options are available for your curtain wall. LowE tints are a popular choice because they limit UV penetration, which cuts down on the fading of furniture, window treatments, and counter tops. LowE glazing options are also energy efficient and greatly assist in maintaining a constant, comfortable temperature within the room. Polycarbonate can also be utilized in curtain walls to provide a clean line and a modern appearance. There are several colors available in varying thicknesses.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Decorative Elements</h2>
Decorative glazing¬†options are available for unique situations such as an interior dividing wall when the end user needs to create privacy from an adjoining room. Acid etch glazing and sandblast finishes are decorative glazing solutions that can be added to curtain walls to meet specific design requirements. Another option is spandrel glass, which is painted to block all visibility. Decorative elements are often added to curtain walls and grid work can be used to add architectural interest and allow the glass panels to match the rest of an existing residence.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Grids &amp; Muntins</h2>
Exterior grids and interior muntins are also available in Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup>‚Äôs curtain walls. The exterior grids¬†are located outside the glass and¬†are traditional in style. Interior muntins are located between the two panes of glass and provide the end user with a bit of contemporary flare. ¬†Interior muntins are very useful for hard to reach places or locations that come into contact with a lot of dirt, such as in front of a windowsill that houses plants. Multiple patterns are available, including a traditional 6 over 3 (or any custom number you would like) radius and Gothic grids.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_column_text]
