<h1>Our History</h1>
<img class="alignright wp-image-30031 size-full" title="Greg with team members" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/GregTouring-1.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="558" />Solar Innovations, Inc. can trace its history back to the early 1950â€™s, when Everlite Greenhouses was founded. Everlite was purchased in the 1980â€™s for its dealer network by an existing sunroom manufacturer in Maryland.

The manufacturer took over the Everlite name and began to distribute replacement parts for the original company, but limited its manufacturing to a new sunroom product and the development of a Mahogany interior/aluminum exterior conservatory. Everlite continued to produce sunrooms through the 1980â€™s and eventually sold its equipment and designs to several entities which began manufacturing sunrooms.

One of these entities moved its operations to York, PA and proceeded to manufacture wood and aluminum products. Greg Header was hired by the company as a consultant in 1997. The company underwent a re-organization and on April 15, 1998, Solar Innovations, Inc. was formed. At that time Greg Header became the President and Darren Coder was named Vice President.

In 1998 the company had a small 10,000 square foot facility but quickly started gaining recognition of the quality and effeciency of the products. As time went on Greg lead an effort to continue to innovate new products for the marketplace. Many of the greenhouses the company was building had openings that needed to be filled with window and door products. The issue became that they could never purchase products that held up the quality of their conservatories and greenhouses so the team began manufacturing their own windows and doors in an effort to build better products than they were receiving from now current competitors.

Solar now resides in a state-of-the art 300,000 sq. ft. corporate office and manufacturing facility that is part of a three building campus, located on 24 acres in Pine Grove, PA, and employs over 160 team members.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:11:"Our History";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:11:"our-history";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-08-29 11:57:36";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-08-29 11:57:36";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:60;s:4:"guid";s:42:"http://solarinnovations.com/?page_id=29739";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
