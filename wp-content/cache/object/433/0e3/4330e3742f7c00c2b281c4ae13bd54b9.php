OurÂ folding glass walls, stacking glass walls, and clear glass walls have been implemented into stadiumsâ€™ press boxes, club seats, luxury suites, bars, and restaurants. With ease of operation, these door and window systems work great in any sports arena.
<h3>FOLDING GLASS WALLS</h3>
<a href="https://solarinnovations.com/our-products/aluminum-doors/folding-glass-walls/">Folding Glass Walls</a>Â can open during favorable weather to provide an unobstructed view of sporting events. These accordion style doors can then be closed at times of harsher weather, providing a barrier between spectators and the elements outside. The doors are thermally broken, allowing fans to view games from a comfortable, temperature controlled environment. Operable swing doors can also be incorporated into folding glass walls to provide an entryway that does not require the entire wall to be opened.

<h3>SLIDE &amp; STACKING GLASS WALLS</h3>
Slide and Stacking Glass Walls consist of individual panels that slide on a track one-by-one and stack parallel or perpendicular with the wall to provide an unobstructed view for spectators. Slide and stacking glass walls can also incorporate swing doors to create an independent entryway when the system is closed during harsh weather. The framing of Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup>â€™ stacking glass walls is constructed from low maintenance aluminum, which does not rot, warp, or rust, ensuring longevity and fewer repairs.

<h3>CLEAR GLASS WALLS</h3>
Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup>Â can engineer clear glass walls for exterior and interior uses, making it an ideal product for stadium suites. The exposed glass offers unobstructed views because the vertical sides of the operable walls feature exposed glass without any metal framing. This allow consumers to get a great view without having to expose themselves to the harsh elements of the inner field. Glass to glass options provide clear views while adding gaskets will increase thermal performance.

<h3>PLANNING FOR OPERABLE STADIUM DOORS</h3>
There are several items to consider when planning for the inclusion of operable stadium doors systems:
<ul>
 	<li>When do the panels need to arrive on the job site? Tell us up front, so Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup> can coordinate our manufacturing lead times with the stadiumâ€™s master schedule.</li>
 	<li>Clearly identify any obstacles with your project manager, such as columns, demising walls, and seating that need to be taken into consideration for door operation or daily use .</li>
 	<li>Provide Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup>Â with proper measurements of non-Solar sightlines.</li>
 	<li>Clearly identify the doorâ€™s primary purpose, such as sound reduction, clear views, or the ability to open a large space.</li>
</ul>
Stadium door projects produced by Solar can be custom designed; there are no standard units on our warehouse shelves. This process provides end users with flexibility when choosing the size of their doors and openings.
