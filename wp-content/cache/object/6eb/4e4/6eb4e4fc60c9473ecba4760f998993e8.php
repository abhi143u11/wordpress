<h2>Wood Conservatories</h2>
Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup>¬†conservatories are available in beautiful custom wood interiors. Our designs pair the beauty of Traditional English wood conservatories with the durability and dependability of aluminum exteriors. Traditional rafter profiles, moldings, trims, and decorative elements can be added to create a historical atmosphere, or a modern look can be achieved with simple decor and clean lines. Moldings and trims on the structure can be formed to match existing architectural elements on your house. The same is true for wood interior panels, which can be customized to virtually any design¬†selected.

Wood possess a warm visual appearance and physical touch; it also acts as an excellent insulator. Wood conservatories can be used for multiple applications. Common uses include dining space, work areas, or a gathering space. The space‚Äôs use will create the function of the interior. A wooden conservatory will provide a classic English element to your home.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Weep System</h2>
Our advanced aluminum weep system carries water and condensation away from the wood, which increases the longevity of the structure. A solid wood structure is typically utilized with smaller structures that have spans of 12‚Äô0‚Äù or less. Any span over 12‚Äô0‚Äù would be recommended to utilize glulam. A solid wooden structure is recommended for structures that are going to be stained, and glulam is used for painted structures.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]

<h2>High Thermal Performance</h2>
Thermal efficiency tends to be higher with a wooden structure because wood allows for lower U-values. The lowered U-value means that the room will maintain a more even temperature and will not lose as much heat in the cold winter months. All of Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup> systems are thermally isolated which prevents the metal frame from touching the glass at any point.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Finishes</h2>
Most homes are constructed of wood, allowing your conservatory to blend into preexisting construction easily. Wood interiors can be composed of a solid wood or glulam interior and maintenance free aluminum exterior. Our structures are available in solid Mahogany or Spanish Cedar. Upon special request, structure interiors can be finished with laminates of Western Red Cedar, Southern Yellow Pine, and Northern White Pine (straight eave applications only), and Douglas Fir. Redwood and Cherry may be integrated into your skylight depending on final engineering requirements.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Staining</h2>
Owners can stain the structure themselves if they would like or Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup> can complete the staining using a 3-5 coat microporous sealer. The first coat seals/protects the wood. The second coat stains the wood and the third coat is a finishing coat.¬†With the addition of decorative trims and other accessories, the potential of Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup> wood systems are limitless.¬†It is the customer‚Äôs responsibility to properly maintain the finish on the wood to preserve the warranty.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Decorative Additions</h2>
A wooden English conservatory achieves its class style through the addition of decorative ornamentation. Ridge cresting and finial options are available for the conservatory roof. Grids can be added to the windows in either a true divided style or a simulated divided option. Base panels are another common element of an English greenhouse. Columns can line the exterior or interior of the conservatory and profiled rafters, along with detailed moldings, are often present on the interior of the conservatory.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_column_text]
