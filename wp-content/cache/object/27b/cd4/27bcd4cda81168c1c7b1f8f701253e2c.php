<h1>Decorative Corners</h1>
Consider decorative corners, or eave spandrels, one of the oldest forms of decorative architecture. An eaveÂ spandrel can be found in buildings as early as ancient Rome, andÂ was historically the space between a wall/column and an arch.Â The Arch of Constantine in the Forum Romanum, which was dedicated in 315 CE, still stands today and exhibits large scale eave spandrels.Â In time, the spandrel also occupied the space between a wall and a square opening.Â In present time, a decorative corner is often attached from a column to the eave of a porch roof.

Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup> offers three styles of decorative corners that areÂ based on historical styles and will add elegance and charm to any application.We construct each corner out of cast aluminum, which makes the piece durable and eliminates chances of rusting.Â Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup> offers the corners in five standard paint colors and any custom paint color your project may require.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_single_image image="38446" img_size="full"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Plant Hanger</h2>
A third use is as a plant hanger which you mount the corner to the wall, and the hanging baskets are hungÂ from the spandrel. Each corner typically holds one hanging basket.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:18:"Decorative Corners";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:18:"decorative-corners";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-08-31 16:51:24";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-08-31 16:51:24";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:25970;s:4:"guid";s:42:"http://solarinnovations.com/?page_id=26056";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
