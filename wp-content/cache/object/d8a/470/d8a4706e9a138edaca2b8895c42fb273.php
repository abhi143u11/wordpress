<h2>Perfect Fit<sup>Â®</sup></h2>
Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup> offers Perfect Fit<sup>Â®</sup> roller and pleated blinds for glazed windows, doors, structures, and skylights. The Perfect Fit<sup>Â®</sup> systems are attached to operable sashes that allow the blinds to move with the unit as it operates, making them an ideal solution for Solarâ€™s products.

The blinds are available in three different styles: roller, pleated, and cellular. Perfect Fit<sup>Â®</sup> blinds allow fresh air to enter the space without sacrificing privacy by remaining lowered when the window or door is open. Perfect Fit<sup>Â®</sup> blinds do not require conventional screws to attach to the window frame, which allows them to be easily removed for cleaning.

The unique Perfect Fit<sup>Â®</sup> blind fits neatly onto the window and enhances your privacy because there are no gaps down the side of the blind. The reduction of gaps at the edge of the blinds increases your privacy. Perfect fit blinds are child safe, featuring no loose cords or loops.

Because the shades are self contained in their unit, window sills are left clutter free. The units can be easily removed for cleaning and reattached quickly when cleaning is complete.

The award winning Perfect Fit<sup>Â®</sup> blind is the only choice to make. The frame fits flush against your window to help reduce heat build up in summer and retain heat in winter, in turn keeping your cooling and heating bills to a minimum. Energy efficient fabric can be added to save up to 15% on energy costs.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]

<h2>L Series Vision Blinds</h2>
Control light and maintain your view with Vision blinds; a striking window blind for the modern home. Vision is a stylish fabric that gently filters and softens daylight, while also offering you the option of a privacy blind.

The exceptional Vision blinds feature sheer metallics, delicate subtle tones, and natural wood weave effects, the perfect collection for any room in the home.

Vision is an innovative window blind that features two layers of translucent and opaque horizontal striped fabric. The front layer moves independently of the back allowing the stripes to glide between each other creating an open and closed effect, with limitless light control.

Sliding the fabric into a closed â€˜opaque-opaqueâ€™ position allows full privacy and solid fabric, whilst the â€˜translucent-opaqueâ€™ position creates a stunning, striped statement. Vision blinds not only look great but are practical too, enabling you to soften excess daylight and reduce the glare entering your room. An easy to use, single control is used to slide the opaque and translucent woven stripes past each other.

The same operation is used to raise or lower the window blind to any height in the window with ease, in the same way the classic roller blind would. A Vision blind will also roll up fully into the attractive cassette head rail to reveal an uninterrupted view to the outside.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]

You can also add those finishing touches, decorative scallops, braids, pulls, poles and eyelets to personalize your choice and co-ordinate with your interior design scheme.Roller blinds are simple in design, stylish, and easy to operate.

The blind can be rolled up or down to achieve the required level of shading you desire. Solarâ€™s roller blind collection is an exciting mix of fabrics specially selected to complement and co-ordinate with any room in the home.

Add style with our contemporary braids, pulls, and poles. Select from acorns, cylinders, barrels, and eyelets in a choice of metallic, leather, or natural finishes.

Roller blinds reduce solar gain in your home during the summer months. Reducing heat build up provides a more acceptable room temperature and reduces air conditioning requirements, saving you money. Roller blinds also reduce the amount of heat lost through windows when itâ€™s cold outside.
