<h1>Structure Design</h1>
Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup>‚Äôs in-house design team can provide assistance with the creation of a custom solution to meet the desired aesthetic of your particular situation whether traditional configurations or special applications are required. Custom glass structures¬†can include multiple turns, additional walls, several roof pitches, and/or unique accessories regardless of the size of the conservatory. Our design team is well equipped to help with unique situations and engineer innovative solutions.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="2/3"][vc_single_image image="38049" img_size="full"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Straight Eave Double Pitch</h2>
A straight eave double pitch configuration is the standard shape for standalone glass structures. This shape provides a uniform space that is tallest along the center axis where the ridge runs directly overhead. This configuration often features a traditional gable roof that can be set at virtually any pitch and allows irregular shapes to be created by combining various pitches. A gable end will typically serve as the attachment point between two structures.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Straight Eave Lean-to</h2>
A straight eave lean-to is¬†the most common configuration when a conservatory or greenhouse is attached to an existing structure. An attached glass structure allows direct access to another facility without having to brave the exterior elements. Straight eave lean-to glass structures can be used in areas with space constraints. They can also be utilized with large structures or along large lengths such as a storefront.¬† The walls of existing structures can act as thermal storage for solar heat in this configuration, which helps to create a comfortable year round environment.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Curved Eave Double Pitch</h2>
In a curved eave double pitch configuration, the glass structure‚Äôs eaves, the point where the walls and roof meet, are curved. Ornate decorative elements can adorn a conservatory or greenhouse to achieve a classical appearance or the framing can be left untouched to create a modern look. Curves can begin high on rafters to allow tall interior elements or low on the rafter to provide a traditional appearance.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_column_text]

<h2 class="vc_custom_heading">Flat Roof</h2>
The term flat roof conservatory is used to describe a glass structure where any portion of the roof remains completely flat. A flat roof is used to ensure views are not obstructed and when interior elements require a certain roof height. Solar Innovations, Inc. recommends traditional roofing material or structural¬†panels be used on the flat portion of the roof to meet¬†snow and water load requirements.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Bull Nose Configuration</h2>
Bull Nose configurations, commonly referred to as ‚Äúconservatory nose‚Äù or ‚ÄúVictorian style‚Äù, consist of a double pitch section that tapers into a ‚Äúnose.‚Äù The ‚Äúnose‚Äù typically projects half the width of the structure and is comprised of six to eight sections that form the radial shape. The ‚Äúnose‚Äù can also be designed as an attached lean-to, without the double pitch section, and attach directly to an existing structure.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_column_text]
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38048" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/structure-design-hip-end.png" alt="" width="680" height="400" /></h2>
<h2>Hip End Structures</h2>
A hip end structure is typically selected for aesthetic purposes. This style can be attached to a building or constructed as a freestanding unit. Each section of the roof slopes downward at a gentle pitch, eliminating gable ends. Please note that the volume of a hip end structure will be smaller than a comparably-sized double pitch conservatory, which may lower heating and cooling costs.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_column_text]<img class="aligncenter wp-image-38052 size-full" src="https://solarinnovations.com/wp-content/uploads/structure-design-ogree.png" alt="Greenhouse" width="680" height="400" />
<h2>Ogee Curve</h2>
Ogee configurations are named in reference to the inverted curved eaves that come to a peak at the roof. This shape is sometimes referred to as an ‚Äús-curve‚Äù or ‚Äúogee curve.‚Äù Ogee style structures are a unique configuration that few manufacturers have the ability to properly execute, but Solar Innovations<sup>¬Æ</sup>‚Äôs bending capabilities allow us to produce quality Ogee curves in-house to minimize lead times.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:16:"Structure Design";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:16:"structure-design";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-08-29 16:18:52";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-08-29 16:18:52";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:38122;s:4:"guid";s:42:"http://solarinnovations.com/?page_id=23566";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
