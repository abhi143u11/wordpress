<h1>Ring and Collars</h1>
Decorative ring and collar supports, also known as cross ties or cross bars, are decorative trusses which link two opposite rafters to provide additional support to large span portal frame and free standing <a href="https://solarinnovations.com/our-products/aluminum-structures/conservatories/">conservatories</a>, <a href="https://solarinnovations.com/our-products/aluminum-structures/sunrooms/">sunrooms</a>, or <a href="https://solarinnovations.com/our-products/aluminum-structures/greenhouses/">greenhouses</a>.Â  These structural supports are intended to maintain a roof shape and structural integrity while adding unique architectural appeal.Â Ring and collars can also be used for purely decorative purposes. When used in a greenhouse, ring and collars often double as plant hangers. A hanging basket can be directly attached to the bar for added growing space. Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup> can, upon request, incorporate decorative aluminum appliquÃ©s to each side of the ring to accent the structures appeal.
