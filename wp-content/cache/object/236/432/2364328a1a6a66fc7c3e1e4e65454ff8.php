<h1>Ornamental Palm Trees</h1>
Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup> now offers a line of ornamental palm trees.Â  These trees provide any home or business with a tropical feel, regardless of location.Â  Steel palm trees are a care free alternative to real palms without the hassle of overgrowth. Different trunk shapes, sizes, and frond options are available to create the perfect palm tree for your property.

Many options are available; single trees can be purchased or groupings of trees can be added for use in larger areas.Â  Ornamental steel palm trees can be placed anywhere. They make the perfect addition to a swimming pool deck or outdoor kitchen.Â  Our steel palms are the perfect complement to an outdoor bar, adding a unique flare for those who love to entertain. Ornamental steel cactus are also available in varying sizes

The trees can offset a homeâ€™s front door or be used as an accent piece in your backyard garden. In commercial settings, the trees can be placed in parking lots, business entrances, and even conference rooms, as the palm trees are constructed for indoor and outdoor use.

The trees are constructed from galvanized or stainless steel. If the galvanized steel trees are left outside for an extended period of time, they begin to weather and create an even more natural look.Â  Decorative planters are available in either concrete or aluminum materials, this aluminum option is only recommended for interior use. Â An outdoor concrete planter is used to weigh the trees down and prevent possible wind damage. This option creates the natural appearance of a potted palm. Indoor applications can also benefit from the use of a planter box; when a planter is not used the trees must be bolted to a concrete pad.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/3"][vc_column_text]
