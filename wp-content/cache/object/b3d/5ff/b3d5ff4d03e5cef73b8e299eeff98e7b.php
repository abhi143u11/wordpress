<h1>Vertical Roll Up Shades</h1>
Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup> offers a line of vertical roll up shades for use on the walls of a glass structure.Â  Conservatories, sunrooms, greenhouses, and garden windows benefit from roll up shades.Â  Stand alone windows and fixed curtain walls can also be fitted with this vertical <a href="https://solarinnovations.com/accessories/shade-systems/">shading system</a>.

Vertical roll up shades can be applied to the roof or walls of a glass room. Â As glass rooms can easily overheat without proper heating and cooling, these shades can help control heat during the summer.Â By adding shading to windows, glares are reduced and user comfort is increased.

Vertical roll up shade systems feature a smooth and straight fabric, which is wound on a roller, as opposed to Roman folded shades, which are pleated. Motors can be used to operate vertical roll up shades, which is especially useful in tall applications. Manual pull cord options are also available.

Each shade system is custom designed and built to fit your windows, walls, or glass structure. Vertical roll up shades are made from fabrics which are well suited for high moisture environments that are found in a greenhouse. Countless fabric options are available, including reflective backings, which are used to keep sunlight out of the room. A Solar Innovations<sup>Â®</sup> sales representative can further discuss which fabric option is correct for you based on your daylight openness, texture, and color selection.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]";s:10:"post_title";s:23:"Vertical Roll Up Shades";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:23:"vertical-roll-up-shades";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-08-31 13:03:59";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-08-31 13:03:59";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:26003;s:4:"guid";s:42:"http://solarinnovations.com/?page_id=26047";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
