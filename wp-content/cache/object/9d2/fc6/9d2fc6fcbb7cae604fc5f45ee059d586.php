<h1>Sliding Windows</h1>
Solar InnovationsÂ® offers thermally enhanced sliding glass windows, which are customized to meet your specific requirements. The windows can be used in either commercial or residential applications, including: patios, sunrooms, or box seats in stadiums.

All sliding windows are constructed with durable aluminum frames, which will weather very well for years to come. Rotting, warping, and constant maintenance to the finish is eliminated when you chose an aluminum window. Eight standard finishes are available to choose from, along with any custom color your specific job may require. Various wood veneer species are available for the sliding windows, including: mahogany, pine, cedar, birch, and Douglas fir. The warm wood interiors help create a traditional, inviting atmosphere.

<h2>Window Tinting</h2>
Sliding windows traditionally use clear glass in their windows; but there are endless tints, types, and thicknesses available. Arguably, the most popular coating available is LowE. This is a type of tint which helps to minimize harmful UV rays from penetrating a space. By using a LowE glass, you are protecting your furnishings and window treatments from fading. This type of glass also helps maintain a comfortable temperature within the room. Impact glazings are available to meet HVHZ requirements.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text]

<h2>Glazing</h2>
Nearly any glazing selection available on the maker today can be used with Solar InnovationsÂ®â€™s sliding glass windows. This versatility allows for glass or polycarbonate, monolithic, or insulated options to be integrated into our system. If you are trying to achieve a modern appearance with your windows, polycarbonate is one of the easiest ways to meet your goal. There are several different colors of polycarbonate available, including: blue, green, clear, opal, and bronze. Regular glass comes in a variety of thicknesses, as does polycarbonate. 8mm polycarbonate is comparable to single pane glass, 25mm polycarbonate is comparable to insulated glass, and 60mm polycarbonate iscomparable to triple pane glass.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_single_image image="38794" img_size="full"][/vc_column][vc_column width="3/4"][vc_column_text]
<h2>Gridwork</h2>
By adding grid work, the windows will have a classic, traditional feel. Mullions can be added to the windows to create a modern clean line look. More than one glazing can be placed in between the mullion sections to create an artistic appearance. Several handle options available in numerous finishes are available.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width="1/4"][vc_column_text]
